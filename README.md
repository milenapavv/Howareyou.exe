# HOWAREYOU.EXE


# General information 

HOWAREYOU.EXE is an interactive generative art project created in Processing (Java). The program allows users to press keys on the keyboard to generate unique shapes that move, fade, and interact dynamically on screen.

The aim of this project was to explore how simple interactions can lead to expressive digital art. blending control and randomness to create something playful, meditative, and ever-changing. It was developed as part of a university data and code subject. 

# Problem it solves:

Many beginner coders find it hard to connect emotionally to code. This project bridges that gap, showing that programming can also be an expressive, artistic act rather than just a technical one.

# Technology used 
- Processing (Java Mode)
- ArrayList library (for managing dynamic shapes)

# Features
- Interactive keyboard-based shape generation
- Randomised colour, size, and motion for each keypress
- Gradual fading and cleanup of old shapes
- Smooth animations with edge bouncing effects
- Reset feature to clear canvas instantly
- Mix of predictable and randomised outcomes, encourages play and creativity

# Requirements
Processing 4 or later installed 

# Steps
1.	Clone or download the project files.
2.	Open the .pde file in Processing.
3.	Click “Run” to start the sketch.

# Usage
- Simply press or spam any key on your keyboard to generate a shape.
- Press the spacebar to clear the screen.

# Project Status
Project is: Complete

This version successfully achieves the original goal, a fully functional, interactive artwork that responds to user input. Future iterations may expand creative controls or introduce sound and rhythm-based interactions.

# Areas to improve:
-	Add UI controls for shape types or colour palettes
-	Include a save feature (export frames or screenshots)

# Acknowledgements

-	Tutorials and documentation from Processing.org
-	Support and feedback from peers and tutors during development
